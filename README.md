### Hi there üëã
I am a Master student in Physics of Data, in my Github you can find some projects developed during my studies ‚ö°

After a bachelor's degree in Physics, in October 2021 I started the master's degree in Physics of Data at the University of Padua. 
The master aims at training a new generation of physicists, capable of combining advanced knowledge in Physics with high-level training in Data Science.


My main interests are Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Statistics and in general the applications of Data Analysis techniques in "real-world" situations.
